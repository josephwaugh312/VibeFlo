### VibeFlo System Architecture Flow Description

#### Overview

VibeFlo is a full-stack web application designed to enhance productivity through the Pomodoro technique while integrating a customizable music experience. The system leverages a structured, scalable architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, database, and third-party integrations.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend to Backend Communication

**Authentication Flow**
- User authentication requests are sent from the Auth Module in the frontend to the `/api/auth` endpoints on the server.
- Credentials are verified through `auth.controller.ts`, leveraging bcrypt for password hashing.
- On successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned to the client, where it is stored in local storage and managed through `AuthContext`.
- Subsequent requests include the JWT in the Authorization header for secure access to protected routes.

**Pomodoro Timer Management**
- The `PomodoroTimer.tsx` component manages the timer interface and logic.
- When a session starts or ends, data is sent to `/api/pomodoro/sessions`.
- The backend controller (`pomodoro.controller.ts`) processes this data and stores it in the Pomodoro Sessions table in PostgreSQL.
- The timer's statistics are aggregated in `StatsContext`, and charts are rendered using Recharts.

**Task List (Todos) Management**
- The `TodoList.tsx` component handles task creation, updating, and reordering with drag-and-drop via @dnd-kit.
- Changes are synced with the server through `/api/pomodoro/todos`, managed by `todo.controller.ts`.
- Task data is persisted in the Todos table in the database.

**Music Player Integration**
- The `MusicPlayer.tsx` component allows users to play music via YouTube embeds (react-youtube).
- Playlist management is handled by `playlist.routes.ts`, and CRUD operations are managed in `playlist.controller.ts`.
- Song metadata and playlists are stored in the Playlists and Songs tables, respectively.

**Theme Customization**
- Users can select or create custom themes, managed by `ThemeBackground.tsx` and stored in `SettingsContext`.
- The server manages these themes through `/api/theme` endpoints, interfacing with `theme.controller.ts`.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend to Database Interactions

**CRUD Operations**
- Auth Controller ‚Üí Users: Handles login, registration, and OAuth authentication.
- Pomodoro Controller ‚Üí Pomodoro Sessions: Manages Pomodoro timer data.
- Todo Controller ‚Üí Todos: Manages task lists and their states.
- Playlist Controller ‚Üí Playlists, Songs: Handles music player data.
- Theme Controller ‚Üí Themes: Manages user-selected themes.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Integrations

**YouTube API**
- The `MusicPlayer.tsx` component interacts with the YouTube API for video playback.

**OAuth Providers**
- Google, GitHub, and Facebook OAuth are handled via passport.js in the backend.
- Tokens are stored in the OAuth Connections table for future reference.

**SendGrid**
- Used for transactional emails such as password resets and verification emails.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Flow

**Hosting**
- VibeFlo is hosted on Render for both the frontend and backend.

**Database Hosting**
- PostgreSQL is used as the main database, managed through node-postgres.

**CI/CD**
- Automated deployments are managed through GitHub Actions, ensuring every push to main triggers a build and deployment.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Security Layers

**JWT Flow**
- Tokens are generated during login and stored in local storage.
- Tokens are validated via `auth.middleware.ts` on every API request.

**Middleware Security**
- `verified.middleware.ts` ensures email verification.
- `admin.middleware.ts` handles role-based access control for admin-specific features.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Testing and DevOps Integration

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests are written for isolated components using Jest.
- Integration tests verify communication between frontend components and backend endpoints.
- End-to-end (E2E) tests are managed through Cypress to ensure user flows function as expected.

**DevOps Practices**
- Database migrations are automated during deployment.
- Docker is used for containerization during local development.
