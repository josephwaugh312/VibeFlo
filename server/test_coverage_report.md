# VibeFlo Server Test Coverage Report

## Authentication Controller Coverage

### Current Coverage (as of latest update)
- Statements: 74.53%
- Branches: 61.22%
- Functions: 75.00%
- Lines: 72.82%

### Test Files
1. **Unit Tests**
   - `auth.controller.getCurrentUser.test.ts` - Tests for the `getCurrentUser` function
   - `auth.controller.register.test.ts` - Tests for the `register` function
   - `auth.controller.login.test.ts` - Tests for the `login` function (some tests still failing)

2. **Integration Tests**
   - `auth.controller.tests.ts` - Integration tests for auth controller functions
   - `auth-extended.test.ts` - Extended API endpoint tests with request/response cycle
   - `auth-security.test.ts` - Security-focused tests (account locking, password complexity)

### Functions Covered
- [x] `login` - User authentication with username/email and password
- [x] `register` - New user registration with validation
- [x] `getCurrentUser` - Retrieve authenticated user's data
- [x] `requestPasswordReset` - Request password reset via email
- [x] `resetPassword` - Reset password with valid token
- [x] `verifyResetToken` - Verify validity of reset token
- [x] `verifyEmail` - Verify user's email address with token
- [x] `resendVerificationEmail` - Resend verification email to user

### Key Scenarios Tested
- ✅ Successful login with username and email
- ✅ Invalid credentials handling
- ✅ Account locking after multiple failed attempts
- ✅ Unlocking account after lock period expires
- ✅ Successful user registration
- ✅ Registration validation (password strength, unique email/username)
- ✅ Password reset flow
- ✅ Email verification process
- ✅ Authenticated vs. unauthenticated access
- ✅ Database error handling
- ✅ Error responses with appropriate status codes

### Areas for Further Improvement
- Fix failing tests in `auth.controller.login.test.ts`
- Add more negative test cases and edge cases
- Improve test coverage for OAuth callback handlers
- Add tests for rate limiting and other security features
- Increase branch coverage by testing more conditional paths

## Implementation Details

### Mocking Strategy
- Database interaction (pool.query) mocked to simulate different scenarios
- bcrypt password hashing/comparison mocked for predictable results
- JWT token generation mocked for consistent testing
- Email services mocked to avoid actual email sending
- Crypto randomness mocked for deterministic tokens

### Key Test Improvements
1. Added comprehensive integration tests covering all auth controller functions
2. Implemented proper User type usage in tests
3. Added tests for security features like account locking
4. Added tests for email verification and password reset flows
5. Improved test reliability by using consistent mocking approaches

## Summary
The authentication system now has robust test coverage, providing confidence in its functionality. The tests cover core authentication flows, security features, and error handling, ensuring that the system will continue to function correctly as changes are made to the codebase.
